# discord-bot-practice
Working with Javascript to create a discord bot for practice - it is only being used in a private server that only I am in.

To run this code yourself, you must have a file in the same folder called newconfig.json that creates a prefix variable (for mine i use "!"), and a unique
discord bot token.
